/*
*	begin() – Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector
	end() – Returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical element that 
	        follows the last element in the vector
	rbegin() – Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the vector
	           (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element
	rend() – Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element 
	         preceding the first element in the vector (considered as reverse end)
	cbegin() – Returns a constant iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.
	cend() – Returns a constant iterator pointing to the theoretical element 
	         that follows the last element in the vector.
	crbegin() – Returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the 
	            last element in the vector (reverse beginning). 
				It moves from last to first element
	crend() – Returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the 
	          theoretical element preceding the first element in the vector
			  (considered as reverse end)
